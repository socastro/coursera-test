    <p>"Everybody needs inspiration
    Everybody needs a song
    A beautiful melody
    When the night's so long
    Cause there is no guarantee
    That this life is easy

    Yeah, when my world is falling apart
    When there's no light to break up the dark
    That's when I, I, I look at you
    When the waves are flooding the shore and I
    Can't find my way home anymore
    That's when I, I, I look at you



    When I look at you
    I see forgiveness
    I see the truth
    You love me for who I am
    Like the stars hold the moon
    Right there where they belong and I know
    I'm not alone

    Yeah, when my world is falling apart
    When there's no light to break up the dark
    That's when I, I, I look at you
    When the waves are flooding the shore and I
    Can't find my way home anymore
    That's when I, I, I look at you

    You, appear, just like a dream to me
    Just like kaleidoscope colors that
    Prove to me
    All I need
    Every breath, that I breathe
    Don't you know?
    You're beautiful

    Yeah yeah...



    When the waves are flooding the shore
    And I cant find my way home anymore
    Thats when I,
    I I look at you
    I look at you

    Yeah yeah...
    Oh oh...
    You appear just like a dream to me...</p>

    <p>“All my life I've been searching for something
      Something never comes, never leads to nothing
      Nothing satisfies but I'm getting close
      Closer to the prize at the end of the rope.

      All night long I dream of the day
      When it comes around and its taken away
      Leaves me with the feeling that I fear the most
      Feeling comes alive when I see your ghost.


      Calm down don't you resist
      You've such a delicate
      And if I give it a twist
      Something to hold when I lose my grip

      Will I find something in there
      To give me just what I need
      Another reason to bleed
      One by one hidden up my sleeve

      Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste
      Weight keep pinning me down

      Will I find a believer
      Another one who believes
      Another one to deceive
      Over and over down on my knees

      If I get any closer
      And if you open up wide
      And if you let me inside
      On and on I've got nothing to hide

      Then I'm done, done on to the next one”</p>

    <p>"Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
      But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
      Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
      But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
      I love the way you lieI can't tell you what it really is
      I can only tell you what it feels like
      And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
      I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight
      As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
      High off of love drunk from my hate
      It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer
      I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
      She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me,
      And I love it, wait
      Where you going, I'm leaving you
      No you ain't, come back
      We're running right back, here we go again
      It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
      I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
      But when it's bad, it's awful
      I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude
      I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
      I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength"
